						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>I'm a developer and engineer that always enjoys challenging myself and putting my problem solving skills to the test. My experience working in the energy and environmental industries has taught me to think creatively and to prepare and adapt to situational changes that may occur at any moment. I enjoy collaborating with others to learn and share new ideas as well as different perspectives. Some of my recent projects are shown below.</p>
